# Airbnb Python Project 
Kavish Sarse 
## Project Overview
This project is about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of New York Airbnb data to identify trends and patterns in rental listings. We clean, visualize, and analyze data using tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
## Dataset
The dataset contains **20,765 entries and 22 features**, including:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each listing  
- **name**: Title of the Airbnb listing  
- **host_name**: Name of the host  
- **neighborhood_group**: Group (borough) where the listing is located  
- **latitude/longitude**: Geolocation of listings  
- **price**: Nightly rental price  
- **room_type**: Type of accommodation (e.g., entire home, private room)  
- **reviews_per_month**: Average monthly reviews for the listing  
- **availability_365**: Number of available days in the year

## Key Findings and Insights

1. **Price & Room Type Trends**:
   - **Manhattan** holds the highest average listing prices, while **entire homes/apartments** dominate the platform and cost significantly more than private/shared rooms.

2. **Availability & Review Patterns**:
   - Listings with **high availability** and **positive reviews** tend to be priced more competitively and attract higher booking rates, offering valuable insights for optimizing host strategies and improving guest satisfaction.

## Recommendations

1. **For Guests**:
   - Consider booking **private rooms in Brooklyn** for budget-friendly stays without compromising location.
   - Prioritize listings with **high availability and strong reviews** for a better overall experience.

2. **For Hosts**:
   - Improve **availability and responsiveness** to increase booking frequency and guest satisfaction.
   - Avoid extreme pricing; optimize price range based on borough and room type to stay competitive.
